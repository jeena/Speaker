Speaker
=======

**Speaker** is a OS X application to let the synthesizer read texts.

Download the latest version of [Speaker.app from the releases](https://github.com/jeena/Speaker/releases/latest).

Copy & paste text into the app, press "Speak" and Alex (or another voice), depending on the automatically recogniced language of the text, reads the text to you. You can pause the text and let him or her speak only selected parts.

You also can chose between different voices and languages. Check out this [Mac OS X hint](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110704093645914) on how to add new voices. You will need to restart Speaker after you've added new voices.
